I have kept a sketchbook since a very early age. A visual diary 

A strong visual vocabulary translates into sitting around the table with people, pushing ideas around on a piece of paper. Creating a half dozen concepts, fleshing out the best ones, and drawing them five times.

Most of these are commercial projects: a couple are the concept drawings, which are far better than the final; a couple personal; and one, lone, student project. 

Sketchbooks have been a part of my life since childhood. It has been the visual diary of my life - a place where ideas are born, observations are made, and where letters that should never be sent reside.


Hands are Though!
I paid two other people to illustrate this brochure, for a local manufacturer.
Frame Strips needed instructions. I rejected both, because I knew that I could do better. Buying my first digital camera, and posing for each step in the processes. It ended up being a very expensive solution. But, entirely happy with the outcome and knowledge. 


Alcalá Christmas
Wax pencil illustration, for a holiday card.
Basilica de Alcalá is i

Subject: Basilica de AlcalaWax pencil illustration of the mission in San Diego, for a holiday card. The client was a manufacturer of small rubber parts. The card was imprinted with a greeting on the inside, the logo on the front, and a die-cut circle in the upper right corner. A small rubber bell glued by hand inside the die-cut, as an example of their capability. 


Surface Study
Pencil in sketchbook. This was done as an assignment, while taking an illustration class at Pasadena City College. 

The assignment was to draw different metal objects.
I combined shinny, matte, and rough tools to create the composition.  

I wish I had crumbled the butcher paper a little less. The background is distracting.
If you zoom-in the detail is quite remarkable. 


Microscopy Holiday
Wax Pencil. 

Done as a holiday greeting for Electron Microscopy Service. They had a very modern logo, but this design abandons that, for a more traditional interpretation of the season. 

It was well received by both management, and recipients. 


Threee - A Well Used Bookstore
This is the base flyer artwork for my bookstore, and independent zine newsstand.
With hours and events (and a really cool map) pasted in the corners for promotion. 

The inspiration comes from a graphic, of an Arabian Nights themed pinball machine in the shop. Three was located in the backroom of a coffeehouse. Located in a dead-end alley, off another alley, along the railroad tracks. 

Coffee was the fuel of our fire.
Literature was food.
Art was given freely. 

Very different times.
I miss them deeply. 


Guess Who - Portait
This was based on a Guess photo advertisement, that featured a woman that looked a lot like one of my first loves. It's a sketchbook entry in pencil, with some features changed to look more like the tomboy I was in love with. 


Lindsay, the Volvo is still running great.
Thank you so much! Props to your Pops. 


Mascot - Auto Group 
A lot of time was spent for this mouse concept, on spec. Comparing other mouse drawings in the media. Finally realizing I was that mouse, wanting to drive home in a new Maita!
Created to be culturally indistinct, and sort of ageless (okay, maybe it's me in that sportscar). 

When presenting to the owner, he took out a rubber stamp from the drawer, of a Disney knockoff image.
I could have worked with that, but I declined to develop further. The difference was stark, and they refused to pay for my previous time. Goodbye. 


Ganesha Valentine
Pen & Ink. 

The Norton Simon admitted patrons for free once a month. A group of friends would regularly roam the galleries. On one of these trips I sat on the floor of the Eastern Room, and started to sketch. 

It became a Valentine, with a quote from the Ramayana inside.
We where both reading Eastern literature. My life is deeply richer for that.
Rama and Sita where at the center of that of that writing. 

I own over thirty volumes of the Arabian Nights now. I can only attribute that to a person that I never felt I would ever lose touch. If Katherine hears this, please know that my library is hers'. 


Hemp Farmer
Graphite pencil, in my sketchbook, on spec. 
 
Henry was why ahead of his time. As a charter member of NORML, he was selling hemp clothing
through word-of-mouth, and quite literally out of the back of his truck.
 
Today, I think it would be an incredible opportunity, and I hope he's making the most of it.
 

The time is now.
