			<h1>Illustration</h1>
			<p>	
				I have kept a sketchbook since a very early age. A visual diary 
				A strong visual vocabulary translates into sitting around the table with people, pushing ideas around on a piece of paper. Creating a half dozen concepts, fleshing out the best ones, and drawing them five times.
				Most of these are commercial projects: a couple are the concept drawings, which are far better than the final; a couple personal; and one, lone, student project. 
				Sketchbooks have been a part of my life since childhood. It has been the visual diary of my life - a place where ideas are born, observations are made, and where letters that should never be sent reside.

				Subject: Basilica de AlcalaWax pencil illustration of the mission in San Diego, for a holiday card. The client was a manufacturer of small rubber parts. The card was imprinted with a greeting on the inside, the logo on the front, and a die-cut circle in the upper right corner. A small rubber bell glued by hand inside the die-cut, as an example of their capability.

			<h2>Surface Study</h2>
			<p>	
				Pencil in sketchbook. This was done as an assignment, while taking an illustration class at Pasadena City College. 

				The assignment was to draw different metal objects.
				I combined shinny, matte, and rough tools to create the composition.  

				I wish I had crumbled the butcher paper a little less. The background is distracting.
				If you zoom-in the detail is quite remarkable.

				Done as a holiday greeting for Electron Microscopy Service. They had a very modern logo, but this design abandons that, for a more traditional interpretation of the season.

			<h2>Threee</h2>
			<p>
				- A Well Used Bookstore 
				This is the base flyer artwork for my bookstore, and independent zine newsstand.
				With hours and events (and a really cool map) pasted in the corners for promotion. 

				The inspiration comes from a graphic, of an Arabian Nights themed pinball machine in the shop. Three was located in the backroom of a coffeehouse. Located in a dead-end alley, off another alley, along the railroad tracks. 

				Coffee was the fuel of our fire.
				Literature was food.
				Art was given freely. 

				Very different times.
				I miss them deeply.

				This was based on a Guess photo advertisement, that featured a woman that looked a lot like one of my first loves. It's a sketchbook entry in pencil, with some features changed to look more like the tomboy I was in love with. 

				Lindsay, the Volvo is still running great.

				A lot of time was spent for this mouse concept, on spec. Comparing other mouse drawings in the media. Finally realizing I was that mouse, wanting to drive home in a new Maita!
				Created to be culturally indistinct, and sort of ageless (okay, maybe it's me in that sportscar). 

				When presenting to the owner, he took out a rubber stamp from the drawer, of a Disney knockoff image.
				I could have worked with that, but I declined to develop further. The difference was stark, and they refused to pay for my previous time. Goodbye.

			<h2>Ganesha Valentine</h2>
			<p>
				Pen & Ink. 

				The Norton Simon admitted patrons for free once a month. A group of friends would regularly roam the galleries. On one of these trips I sat on the floor of the Eastern Room, and started to sketch. 

				It became a Valentine, with a quote from the Ramayana inside.
				We where both reading Eastern literature. My life is deeply richer for that.
				Rama and Sita where at the center of that of that writing. 

				I own over thirty volumes of the Arabian Nights now. I can only attribute that to a person that I never felt I would ever lose touch. If Katherine hears this, please know that my library is hers'.
