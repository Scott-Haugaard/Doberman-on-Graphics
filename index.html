		<h1>Branding</h1>
		<p>	
		logo can convey the core focus, or the breadth of and industry, and the culture and attitude in a retail or service environment.
		It attracts through connection in attituded or  
		A powerful tool that communicates information and builds a relationship with the consumer. 
		Good design is inviting, and steers outward perception by projecting an esthetic that leaves an impression.
		A well thought-out logo reproduces properly through a variety of different media. 
		Most of these designs are custom letterforms, created for a specific application, and have been published.
		Typography has always been an interest of mine, well before my career in the graphic arts industry. I'm the type of guy that can stare at a menu for twenty minutes, and not know what to order because I wasn't actually reading it, or rewind just the end credits of a movie. I am part of the Letraset generation, and born with an Xacto blade in one hand and a Sharpie in the other.
