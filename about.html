Little Giant Printers
I started working at the shop on Valentines Day. What began as a love story, became a marriage. An industry that combined art, large equipment, new technologies, and a history of changing the world, interested me greatly. 

What began as wax paste-up, darkroom and light-tables,  sudden became digital.
The internet was being born, and the first smart phones came to market. 

My experience in the Coachella Valley was unique, and my life was filled with art and music. 

When I took over the business.
