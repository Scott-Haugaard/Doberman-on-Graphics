	<h1>Industrial Design</h1>

		<p>
			This is where my heart lies. With the things that people use in their daily lives. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I was the kid that disassembled the walky-talky, and marveled at the attachments you can integrate into a vacuum. Nothing is ever perfect, and there is not a single consumer product that does not warrant improvement. 
		</p>
		<p>	
			A few illustrations are college submissions, a couple are Art Center projects, but most are just ideas hitting paper. Some may seem dated, though the solutions behind the products are truly unique. Ckit
		</p>
		<p>			
			Why constantly remake the objects around us, 
		</p>
		<p>	
			you are as curious about the world around you that I am. 
		</p>
		<p>	
			Spyder
			A chair with locomotion, that can be achieved by rocking or bouncing, so you crawl across the floor. The leg joints articulate, using springs and bumpers. 
		</p>
		<p>			
			It bares the telltale hourglass ..
			Enjoy my pretties. Have fun !
		</p>
		<p>
			Tree of Light
			A floor lamp comprised of gooseneck tubes, and LED tips. These can be focused from a flood light to narrow spot, in any color. The arms can be positioned in an infinite number of arrangements, while the lights provide even more drama.
		</p>
		<p>			
			The base is a weighted by a large semi-circle, providing am even balance, with a wide footprint.
		</p>
		<p>			
			Quake
			This table concept incorporates symmetry and chaos, by creating visual tension, and perceived motion. Weight with impossible lightness, as it appears to want to collapse under it's own weight, as gravity seems to shift, even in stillness.
		</p>
		<p>			
			The fun part is the ability to move the center slab into other positions, and to rotate the legs, creating different physicality.  
		</p>
		<p>			
			Two inch Serpentine slabs, on 1.25" bent chromed legs. About 20" wide, by hip-high. Background inspired by the Frank Lloyd Wright's Ennis house.
		</p>
		<p>				
			Warptrobe
			Doors and Drawers both share the same hinges. 
		</p>
		<p>			
			Enough capacity to comfortably host a single person. 
			Everything to dress is right in front of you.
			The vanity mirrors show every angle. Ouch!
		</p>
		<p>			
			Room for shoes on one side would eliminate the need of a joint. Future iteration could have asymmetrical hinges, based on the depth of drawers and voids. 
		</p>
		<p>			
			SPCAmbulance
			A quick-response vehicle for animal rescue. The rear compartment can accommodate a large bear, or two. 
		</p>
		<p>			
			The low center of gravity, wide stance, and high clearance make it stable through rough terrain. 
		</p>
		<p>			
			Medical supplies are accessible from the interior, and pullout drawers on the outside. Oversized equipment is stored below, across the chassis, or on the roof. 
		</p>
		<p>				
			Neptone
			A jukebox that can load two disks simultaneously,
			so segues can be created between songs. 
		</p>
		<p>			
			Disks are mounted face down, with a system of LEDs ringed around the disks' mirrored surfaces. Providing a light show, projecting from all sides. 
		</p>
		<p>			
			Integrates with apps, without m
